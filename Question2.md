## Question:
**Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?**
Here are a list of use cases for wrapper NFT: 
1. NFT holders dislike the progress of the team and decided to fork another project.
2. Cross chain bridging - wrap the nft and bridging to another chain
3. Wrapped NFT and turn into a fragmented NFT, it will incase liquidity of the NFT and other users can buy/sell the fragmented NFTs.
